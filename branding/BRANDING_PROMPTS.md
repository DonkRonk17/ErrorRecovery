## 1. TITLE CARD (16:9 Landscape)

**File:** `errorrecovery_title_card.png`  
**Dimensions:** 1920x1080px (16:9)  
**Purpose:** GitHub README hero image, presentations, documentation headers

### DALL-E Prompt:

```
A futuristic horizontal banner for a software tool called "ErrorRecovery" with 16:9 aspect ratio.

The design features a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle hexagonal grid pattern fading into the distance. 

Central composition shows an abstract visualization of error recovery: a glowing red warning symbol (triangle with exclamation mark) on the left side, transitioning through a cyan (#00d4ff) glowing digital pathway/circuit pattern to a green checkmark symbol on the right side. The pathway should look like data flowing and being processed.

The word "ErrorRecovery" appears in bold, clean sans-serif typography (like SF Pro or Helvetica Neue Bold) in pure white, with subtle cyan glow underneath.

Tagline below in smaller text: "Automatic Detection & Recovery from Common Failures"

Small geometric accent elements (triangles, circuits, nodes) scattered subtly in corners. Professional tech aesthetic, minimalist composition, cinematic lighting with cyan rim lights. No photorealistic elements - pure digital/vector style with depth.
```

## 2. LOGO MARK (1:1 Square)

**File:** `errorrecovery_logo.png`  
**Dimensions:** 512x512px (1:1)  
**Purpose:** Profile images, favicons (scaled down), app icons, watermarks

### DALL-E Prompt:

```
A square logo mark for a software tool called "ErrorRecovery" with 1:1 aspect ratio.

Dark navy background (#0a0e27) with extremely subtle gradient to deep charcoal at edges.

The logo concept: A stylized shield or protective barrier shape made of glowing cyan (#00d4ff) circuit-like lines. Inside the shield, there's an abstract representation of recovery - a broken/fragmented element (suggesting an error) being pieced back together or transforming into a complete/whole element.

Alternative interpretation: A circular ring (like a loading/refresh symbol) that's partially broken (red/coral segment representing error) with the rest in glowing cyan, and an arrow suggesting the cycle of recovery.

The design should be simple enough to work at small sizes but detailed enough to be interesting at full size. Clean vector style with glowing edges. No text in this image - pure iconography. Tech aesthetic, suggests protection, recovery, and resilience.
```

## 3. HORIZONTAL LOGO (3:1 Wide)

**File:** `errorrecovery_horizontal.png`  
**Dimensions:** 1200x400px (3:1)  
**Purpose:** Website headers, email signatures, document headers, PyPI/GitHub badges

### DALL-E Prompt:

```
A wide horizontal logo lockup for a software tool called "ErrorRecovery" with 3:1 aspect ratio.

Dark navy background (#0a0e27) that's completely clean with no patterns (for versatility).

Left side: The logo mark - a stylized shield/protective barrier made of glowing cyan (#00d4ff) circuit lines, containing an abstract recovery symbol (a broken element being made whole).

Right side: The word "ErrorRecovery" in clean, modern sans-serif typography (Helvetica Neue Bold or SF Pro Display Bold style) in pure white with very subtle cyan glow on the bottom edge of letters.

Optional: Very subtle small geometric accent (single triangle or node) after the text.

The logo mark and text should be perfectly balanced with appropriate spacing. Professional software branding style, suitable for both light and dark backgrounds when the navy background is removed. Clean vector style, no photorealistic elements. Minimalist and modern tech aesthetic.
```

## 4. APP ICON (1:1 Simplified)

**File:** `errorrecovery_icon.png`  
**Dimensions:** 256x256px (1:1)  
**Purpose:** Application icon, taskbar icon, shortcut icon, mobile app icon

### DALL-E Prompt:

```
A simplified app icon for a software tool called "ErrorRecovery" with 1:1 aspect ratio, designed to be recognizable at very small sizes.

Deep navy background (#0a0e27) with slightly rounded corners (standard app icon shape).

The icon shows an extremely simplified representation: A bold, clean shield or circular shape with a refresh/recovery arrow motif. The shield/circle is cyan (#00d4ff) with glowing edges. Inside or integrated with it is a simple arrow suggesting recovery/retry (like a refresh symbol but more abstract).

Alternative concept: A simple "E" and "R" letterform combined creatively with a recovery arrow element, all in glowing cyan on dark navy.

The design must be bold, instantly recognizable at 16x16px, and work in monochrome. No gradients that would be lost at small sizes - rely on shape contrast. Clean, minimal, iconic. Think of how simple and effective the Python logo or VS Code icon are. Professional software aesthetic.
